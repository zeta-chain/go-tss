## How to play

* modilfy the docker-compose file at build/docker-compose.yml according to your local paths.

* run the docker-compose, itl will create 4 parties with threshold of 2.


### How to contribute

* Create an issue or find an existing issue on https://github.com/zeta-chain/go-tss/-/issues
* Assign the issue to yourself
* Create a branch using the issue id, for example if the issue you are working on is 600, then create a branch call `600-issue` , this way , gitlab will link your PR with the issue
* Raise a PR , and submit it for the team to review
* Make sure the pipeline is green
* Once PR get approved, you can merge it to master

### the semantic version and release
Go-TSS manage changelog entry the same way like gitlab, refer to (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/changelog.html) for more detail. Once a merge request get merged into master branch,
if the merge request upgrade the [version](https://github.com/zeta-chain/go-tss/-/blob/master/version), then a new release will be created automatically, and the repository will be tagged with
the new version by the release tool.

### How to generate a changelog entry
A scripts/changelog  is available to generate the changelog entry file automatically.

Its simplest usage is to provide the value for title:
```
./scripts/changelog "my super amazing change"
```
At this point the script would ask you to select the category of the change (mapped to the type field in the entry):
```bash
>> Please specify the category of your change:
1. New feature
2. Bug fix
3. Feature change
4. New deprecation
5. Feature removal
6. Security fix
7. Performance improvement
8. Other
```
The entry filename is based on the name of the current Git branch. If you run the command above on a branch called feature/hey-dz, it will generate a changelogs/unreleased/feature-hey-dz.yml file.

The command will output the path of the generated file and its contents:
```
create changelogs/unreleased/my-feature.yml
---

merge_request:
author:
type:
